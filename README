this thing is bad and i cant be bothered to make it good because it doesnt matter

the only holiday it counts is memorial day because thats the only one that exists
between when i made this and when school ends

docker because i can: 
`docker build -t countdown .`
`docker run -p 8080:80 countdown`
site will be up at localhost:8080
